# InDesign Template Files

This directory should contain your InDesign template files for the AstroBookGenerator.

## Required Files

Place the following file in this directory:

- `Cover - AstroBookGenerator.indt` - The main InDesign template file with placeholders

## Placeholders

The template should include the following placeholders:

- `{{NAME}}` - Will be replaced with the person's name
- `{{BIRTH_INFO}}` - Will be replaced with birth date and time
- `{{LOCATION}}` - Will be replaced with birth location

## Note

The actual template files (.indt) and image assets (.png) are not stored in the repository due to their large size. You'll need to create or obtain these files separately.

Refer to the `indesign_template_instructions.md` file in the main directory for details on how to set up your template.
